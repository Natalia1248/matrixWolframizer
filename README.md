# The Matrix Wolframizer
Matrix Wolframizer is a site for converting matrices into their Wolfram language representation, so you can plug them into (Wolfram Alfa)[https://www.wolframalpha.com/]. For example,

|1|2|

|3|4|

comes out as {{1,2},{3,4}}.
Use the mouse or arrow keys to move around, or press the enter key to "wolframize" at any given moment. You can fill matrix entries with any Unicode character, or nothing at all. Besides the mouse, you can use Ctr+arrow keys to move inside one cel.
Alright, I think that's it, if you have any comments or find any bugs, feel free to let me know, and enjoy! :)
